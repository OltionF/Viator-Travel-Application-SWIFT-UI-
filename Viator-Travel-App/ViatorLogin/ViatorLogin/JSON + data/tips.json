With so much exposure to adverts, TripAdvisor reviews, recommendations from friends and seductive brochures it can be a daunting prospect to choose a destination, let alone contemplate what to do while you are there. Maybe that is why so many of us settle for an all-inclusive package that takes away the hassle of planning and organising our trip."

Perhaps you’re going on a journey of self-discovery that you would rather undertake on your own, travelling with a friend and meeting new people, enjoying some time away as a couple, or maybe you would like to bring your young grandchildren along. There are many aspects to a great holiday and these requirements are very individual. Try to ensure that the experience is going to be enjoyable for all of you by thinking about what type of travel your family/friends enjoy, and discuss with them how to meet both your objectives."
